## Make Change Project

### First week homework for Skill Distillery

### Overview

This program simulates a cash transaction interface. It prompts the user to input an amount owed and an amount paid for a transaction. I calculates what the change would be and broken down by bill and coin that would need to be given back.

###  How to run

User inputs amount that is owed for a transaction and then they are prompted to input the amount that was paid.

If the user enters an amount paid that is less than the amount owed, then it will return a message telling them that the tender is not enough.

After the program calculates and breaks down what the change is, it then asks the user if they would like another transaction.

### Technologies/topics used

while loops, methods, if statements, casting data types, BidDecimal, and modular calculations.

### Lessons

I learned that in order to sift down the different currencies, the mod operator is imperative. In order to be able to state the amount of change to return in a more readable format, I had to use a decimal format method to round the change to two decimals.
